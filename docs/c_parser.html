<h1>A C99 Parser</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this project is to create a recursive descent parser for C99. The output from the parser should be a parse tree.
</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>

<p>
I started the project in January 2001 - but after working for a few days I was not able to continue work on this project. I managed to create a working parser that is almost fully C99 compatible. However, the parser does not generate a parse tree yet.
</p>

<p>Since it is unlikely that I will be able to devote time to this project in the immediate future, I have decided to release the code as it is, in the hope that someone can use it and make something of it.
</p>

<h2>Licencing Terms</h2>
<p>
The parser code is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or any later version.
</p>

<p>
The lexer code is a modified version of the C lexer in the <a href="http://ups.sourceforge.net/">UPS C Debugger</a>, and is copyrighted by its author Mark Russell.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>You can checkout the source as follows:</p>
<div class="syntax">
<pre class="syntax">
svn checkout http://try-catch-finally.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cparser/ cparser
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>

<p>
After extracting the source into a directory, you can run <tt>make</tt> to build an executable called c_parser. The syntax for invoking c_parser is as follows:
</p>

<div class="syntax">
<pre class="syntax">
c_parser [input-file]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The input file must not contain pre-processer directives.
</p>

<p>
The parser is silent by default. You can define two environment variables if you want to see the parsing process. Set LEX_DEBUG=1 to start lexer trace messages. Set DEBUG to 1,2 or 3 to generate parser trace messages.
</p>
